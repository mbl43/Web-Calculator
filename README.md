# Web Calculator Extension

## Overview
This is a simple and efficient calculator web extension that allows users to perform quick calculations directly from their 
browser without opening a separate app. Suppose you're browsing the Flipkart website and planning to purchase a Kinder Joy pack containing 20 pieces 
for a total price of â‚¹974. To determine the cost of a single Kinder Joy, simply divide the total price by the number of pieces:  

**Price per piece = â‚¹974 Ã· 20 = â‚¹48.70**  

You can easily calculate this using our **Web Calculator Extension** by right-clicking on the total price, 
selecting the division operation from the context menu, and entering the number of pieces. This ensures quick and hassle-free calculations while shopping online! ðŸ˜Š
